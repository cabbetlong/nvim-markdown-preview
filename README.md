# nvim-markdown-preview

Markdown preview in the browser using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [live-server](https://github.com/tapio/live-server) through Neovim's [job-control API](https://neovim.io/doc/user/job_control.html).

## Usage

Open a markdown file in vim and run `:MarkdownPreview`. The preview opens in a new browser tab which will be reloaded whenever you `:write` the buffer. If you accidentally close your browser tab or want to change the theme just run the command again. The file needs to be written to disk before you can start the preview.

## Features

* Asynchronous
* Produces "standalone" html files (injected css)
* Custom themes (`github`, `solarized-dark`, `solarized-light`)
* Auto-reloads browser tab on save
* Serves assets from the current working directory (embed pictures in your markdown etc.)
* Custom markdown input formats
  - [pandoc markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)
* [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) for formatting LaTeX math
* Syntax highlighting from the [Kate Editor themes](https://github.com/KDE/syntax-highlighting#color-theme-files)

## Requirements

* `pandoc`
* `live-server` (Node.js)

`pandoc` and `live-server` executables should be installed and accessible in your `$PATH`.

### Pandoc

Pandoc should be available in most linux distributions and on macOS via brew and Windows via chocolatey.

On [macOS](https://pandoc.org/installing.html#macos) using Homebrew:

```
brew install pandoc
```

For [Linux](https://pandoc.org/installing.html#linux):

* Ubuntu `sudo apt install pandoc`

* Fedora `sudo dnf install pandoc`

For [Windows](https://pandoc.org/installing.html#windows):

Either download the executable or get it with Chocolatey

```
choco install pandoc
```

For other systems please see the links in the description on how to install.

#### Pandoc mermaid filter
If you wanna preview yout mermaid diagrams, you need install mermaid filter for pandoc.
```
npm install --global mermaid-filter
```

### live-server

Assuming you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed:
```
npm install -g live-server
```

or if you prefer yarn
```
yarn global add live-server
```

## Installation

If you are using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

`Plug 'davidgranstrom/nvim-markdown-preview'`

source the file (`:source %`) (or restart vim) and then run `:PlugInstall`

## Documentation

### Usage

There is only a single command:

```vim
:MarkdownPreview [theme]    Starts the browser preview of the current file.
                            Optional argument to select a theme.

                            The available themes are currently:
                            * github
                            * solarized-light
                            * solarized-dark

```

### Customization

Set this variable in your init.vim to specify a default theme for the preview.
The default is the github theme.

```vim
let g:nvim_markdown_preview_theme = 'solarized-light'
```
Set this variable to specificy the pandoc input format (--format/-f) option.
The default is `gfm` (github flavoured markdown).

```vim
let g:nvim_markdown_preview_format = 'markdown'
```

Take a look at `:help nvim-markdown-preview` for complete documentation and examples.

## Q & A

**Q:** Why doesn't the preview update in real-time while I type in vim?

**A:** This plugin simply doesn't work like that. It is aimed to be "lightweigth" (if you already are a node.js/pandoc user that is).
It simply provides some live update capabilities around what is essentially `:w !pandoc % -o /tmp/file.html`

**Q:** I want the preview tab to open automatically without typing `:MarkdownPreview`

**A:** Sure, use an `autocmd` like:
```
autocmd FileType markdown MarkdownPreview
```

Or the `<Plug>` mapping to bind it to the key of your choice
```
nmap <cr> <plug>(nvim-markdown-preview)
```

## TODO

The markdown file must be written to disk first. It should be possible to use Pandoc `stdin` and pipe the buffer content using `jobsend()` instead.
